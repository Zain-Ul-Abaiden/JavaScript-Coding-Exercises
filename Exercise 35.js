/* Q 35: Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet! */

let pet_animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'lion'];

for (let index = 0; index < pet_animals.length; index++) {
    console.log(pet_animals[index]);   
}

// Modify for loop

for (let index = 0; index < pet_animals.length; index++) {
    console.log(`A ${pet_animals[index]} would make a great pet.`);    
}

console.log(`Any of these animals would make a great pet!`);
