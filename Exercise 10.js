/* Q 10: Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

/*Program Number: 6
Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces. */

let personName = "\nZain Ul Abiaden\t";
console.log(personName);
console.log(personName.trim());

/* Program No: 7
Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message. */
let favoriteNumber = 7;
console.log(`My favorite number is ${favoriteNumber}.`);
